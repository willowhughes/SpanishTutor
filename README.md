TODO:
- improve latency
    - I feel that two good ways to improve latency is to:
    - figure out streaming stt so its like iphone stt on messages where you see the words pop up as you speek and then the text is ready to send to the llm as soon as you are done speaking
        - Use VAD to get a start on the stt when the user pauses
        - establish a session with api
        - compress speech audio
    - stream the llm output one sentence at a time over to the stt so it can get started on each sentence as it's ready
    - stream the tts audio as it's ready from googles api

STT: [100ms][100ms][100ms]... → Ready ~100ms after done speaking
LLM: [sentence1: 300ms] → [sentence2: 300ms] → [sentence3: 300ms]
Translation: separate thread
TTS: Starting playing asap (before whole speech is finished) [audio1: 200ms] → [audio2: 200ms] → [audio3: 200ms]

- Make llm tell student when things are said incorrectly
- Have a post-convo preformance eval
